## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This application is built using a modern, scalable **TALL Stack** approach for mobile development (Tailwind CSS/Alpine.js/Laravel/Livewire concept adapted for mobile):

### Frontend

  * **Framework:** **Flutter** (Dart)
  * **UI/UX:** Custom theming with the main colors set to a professional green palette.
  * **State Management:** Standard Flutter `StatefulWidget` and component-level state for simplicity and performance.

### Backend & Services

  * **Backend as a Service (BaaS):** **Supabase** (PostgreSQL)
      * **Data Models:** `wellness_resources` (for content) and `mood_logs` (for user tracking).
      * **Auth:** Handles user signup, login, and session persistence.
  * **AI Integration:** **Gemini API** (Google)
  * **Video Playback:** **YouTube Player Flutter** package.
  * **Networking/Caching:** `supabase_flutter`, `cached_network_image`.

### Architecture Highlights

The app utilizes the **AppShell Architecture** in `main.dart` to provide a persistent, clean `BottomNavigationBar` that manages five distinct screens, ensuring a smooth, single-activity mobile experience.

## üí° Learning & Development Showcase

This project served as a comprehensive exploration of key development challenges:

  * **Complex Navigation:** Successfully implemented the **AppShell Pattern** to manage the `BottomNavigationBar` and inter-page routing cleanly.
  * **Asynchronous Data Handling:** Managed state and UI updates using `FutureBuilder` to handle data retrieval from Supabase in the background (Resources and Moods).
  * **API Syntax Migration:** Successfully adapted to changes in the `supabase-flutter` package, removing the deprecated `.execute()` call.
  * **UX/Branding:** Designed and implemented a custom, symbolic logo and applied consistent theming.
